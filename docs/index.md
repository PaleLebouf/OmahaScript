# Welcome
This is a project that was made to create proper documentation for Halo Reach's Megaloscript, which is used for gametypes. A lot of this is being pulled from Kornman00's work on Ksoft which was the original tool used to extract and convert megalo script files into XML. I'll be adding all the knowledge I've been able to find about Halo Reach's megalo script here for ease of access.
